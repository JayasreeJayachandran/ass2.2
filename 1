HDFS:(Hadoop Distributed File System)
           >HDFS is used to store the data and its main functions is to distribute the storage system in an efficient manner
           such that it has high fault tolerance and scalability.
           >HDFS finds hardware problems and solve the issues on its own .This property made them outstanding.
           >It is based on GFS(google file system).
           >Its another uniqueness is its replication factor,even if there is a failure or data is lost it has a backup file
           to provide the data.
           >These files are divided into blocks and distributed in clusters.
           >HDFS normally deals with huge amount of data where the data is written once but can be read n number of times.
           >It is cost efficient since it uses commodity hardwares for storing data.
           >HDFS has three main parts Master daemon,slave daemon,backup master daemon
           >Each has its own function .Master daemon knows where the datas are recided and controls the overall function where 
           slave daemon stores the data.Backup daemon takes backup of master daemon to takeover controll when the master daemon fails.
